# VessellFramework Community Skill
## Version 1.0

> **Legacy repository guidance:** Contribution examples below describe the former software scope. They do not define research ethics, participant recruitment, or organizational-psychology evidence standards; use the current charter for research changes.

## 1. Purpose

Make it easy for others to contribute well. This skill is the executable
companion to `CONTRIBUTING.md`: it tells a contributor (or their assistant)
exactly what a merge-ready change looks like.

## 2. Ground Rules

- Be respectful and assume good intent. This is a learning-in-public
  project by an analyst learning software engineering.
- No harassment, no personal data in issues or PRs, no secret keys in
  code or fixtures.
- The maintainer's decision on scope is final.

## 3. What a Merge-Ready Change Looks Like

Every PR must satisfy all of these:

1. **Tests.** New behavior ships with regression tests under `tests/`.
   Run the full suite: `python -m pytest tests/ -q` — all green.
2. **Types and lint.** `mypy` and `ruff` must be clean on touched files.
   The repo's own `run_framework.py` health gate runs mypy on the
   installer; keep it passing.
3. **Schemas.** New machine-readable records get a JSON schema under
   `schemas/` and a validation test.
4. **Provenance honesty.** Framework code must never invent evidence,
   conclusions, or verification. The case report boundary ("structures
   supplied evidence; does not independently verify conclusions") is
   load-bearing — do not weaken it.
5. **Docs.** User-facing changes update the relevant `*_SKILL_*.md`
   and/or `README.md`.
6. **Integrity manifest.** If you touch a file tracked in
   `VessellFramework_v3.8.1_SHA256_Manifest.json`, regenerate the manifest
   and confirm `python verify_manifest.py` passes.

## 4. Welcome Contributions

- New scanner adapters under `vessell/app/` (follow the existing
  adapter pattern + tests).
- Additional weight-table calibrations with documented methodology.
- Forecast calibration studies using the forecasting skill.
- Documentation, examples, and typo fixes.
- Bug reports with a minimal reproduction.

## 5. Out of Scope

- Changes that weaken the provenance firewall, harm gate, or the
  do-not-invent boundary.
- New network integrations without an offline fixture and test.
- Breaking the `vessell` package's Python >= 3.13 floor without
  discussion in the issue first.

## 6. Filing Issues

Include: what you ran, what you expected, what happened, the full
error output, and your Python version. One issue per problem.
