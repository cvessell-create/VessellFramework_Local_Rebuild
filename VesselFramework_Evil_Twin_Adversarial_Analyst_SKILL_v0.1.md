# VesselFramework Evil Twin Adversarial Analyst
## Version 0.1 - Research Candidate

## Status


The Evil Twin is a defensive challenge layer. It does not replace the primary
analyst, deterministic validators, human review, or the Provenance Firewall.
It does not perform unauthorized access, credential capture, exploitation,
wireless impersonation, or remote action.

## Trigger

Use when a primary analysis, recommendation, control-selection decision,
forecast, or evidence product needs an independent challenge pass before
release or action. The primary and Evil Twin may share the evidence record, but
the Twin must receive the primary conclusion as a claim to attack, not as a
conclusion to endorse.

Do not use the Twin to manufacture evidence, convert a hypothesis into a fact,
or create false independence by repeating the same source in different words.

## Governing Order

1. Operator protection and Harm Gate
2. Evidence Assurance and Provenance Firewall
3. Canonical VesselFramework doctrine
4. Primary analysis
5. Evil Twin challenge
6. Adjudication and release decision

## Challenge Sequence

### 1. Boundary

Extract the primary claims. Mark each as SOURCE-ESTABLISHED, FRAMEWORK
SYNTHESIS, WORKING HYPOTHESIS, or ILLUSTRATIVE. Flag absolute language such as
"always", "never", "guarantees", "proves", and "eliminates" unless the record
actually supports that scope.

### 2. Provenance

Resolve every material evidence item to its source and upstream lineage. Treat
missing, stale, conflicting, circular, or unresolved lineage as a limitation.
Derivative repetition is not independent corroboration.

### 3. Mechanism and placement

Test whether the proposed control performs the claimed function and whether it
acts at the point where the attack must pass or succeed. Check passive versus
inline behavior, prevention versus detection, perimeter versus lateral
movement, compensating versus corrective function, and fail-open or fail-closed
conditions.

### 4. Dependencies and failure modes

List required identity, endpoint, telemetry, policy, administrator, vendor,
network, availability, and configuration dependencies. Ask how the control
fails, what an attacker can bypass, and whether the recommendation assumes a
trust relationship that has not been established.

### 5. Alternatives and disconfirmation

State the strongest competing explanation or control. Identify the residual
attack path that remains even if the proposed control works. Give one concrete
observation, test, or source that would disconfirm the primary claim.

## Required Output

Return a structured challenge containing:

- primary claim under review;
- evidence and provenance limitation;
- challenge category;
- severity: LOW, MODERATE, HIGH, or BLOCKING;
- reasoning in accepted domain terminology;
- what survives challenge;
- what must be downgraded or withdrawn;
- residual path or dependency;
- strongest alternative;
- next discriminating test;
- release recommendation: PASS, REVISE, or BLOCK.

The adjudicator must not average the primary and Twin outputs. It preserves
claims that survive, downgrades claims that fail, records unresolved evidence
debt, and assigns the final permissible confidence and posture.

For prompt or agent behavior cases, challenge whether the evidence consists of
visible, consented prompts/responses and independently checked outcomes.
Keystroke counts or file-edit timing do not reveal hidden reasoning, prompt
intent, or causality. Reject datasets collected through keylogging, secret
capture, or unconsented private-store scraping.

## Deterministic Offline Gate

The single-file runtime provides an offline challenge for repeatable
checks. It can flag absolute claims, missing evidence language, passive-versus-
blocking confusion, VPN-trust overclaims, perimeter-only answers to lateral
movement, compensating/corrective confusion, and missing alternatives or
residual paths. Passing the offline gate means only that no configured text
signature was found; it is not semantic validation or proof of security.

## Harm and Security Boundary

Keep the analysis defensive and bounded. Do not provide instructions for
credential theft, rogue access points, exploitation, persistence, evasion, or
unauthorized testing. For consequential security, legal, financial, health,
safety, or reputational decisions, default to VERIFY and require appropriate
human or professional review.
