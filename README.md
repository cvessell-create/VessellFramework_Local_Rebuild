# VessellFramework

VessellFramework is an auditable Python runtime and a set of doctrine and skill artifacts for evidence, provenance, case analysis, forecasting, and approved remediation control.

Author: Christopher R. Vessell

For the code-by-code game breakdown and framework architecture adaptation,
see [GAME_DEVELOPMENT_SKILL.md](GAME_DEVELOPMENT_SKILL.md). The new
[bounded analyst workflow](vessell/workflow.py) reuses the existing gates,
pipeline and correction machinery; game development itself remains paused.

Package version: v3.9.1 with verified game-pattern workflow adaptations.
The separate game feature build remains paused and is not a completed release.
Executable
workflows, source contracts, persistent study receipts and regression checks
are available; independent field efficacy is not claimed.

The [game integration](docs/game-integration.md) connects the rebuild to
[Hail to the Analyst](https://github.com/cvessell-create/hail-to-the-analyst):
autonomous FPS playback, a real Python provenance coach and the experimental
*Signal Recall* sequel. No external accounts or real-world action systems are connected.

Start with [operational case studies](docs/operational-case-studies.md):

```sh
python -m pip install .
vessell-study --spec case_studies/claim_correction/spec.json --output-dir outputs/study-001
vessell-study --verify-only --output-dir outputs/study-001/framework
```

This writes actual managed local consumer files and compares their correction
outcomes against an explicit snapshot-only baseline. Authorization, fail-closed
gates and provenance controls remain enforced. External systems are not modified.

For the complete skill, agent, executable-code, scanner, and authorized remediation map, start with [VesselFramework_Agent.md](VesselFramework_Agent.md). Historical artifacts retain their original `VesselFramework` names; the active Python namespace is `vessell`.

## Reviewer quick orientation

If you are reviewing this as an academic rough-working submission, read in this order:

1. `PROFESSOR_README.md` (purpose, contribution, current limits, and requested feedback)
2. `VesselFramework_MetaMatrix_Framework_v3.8_v3.9_Combined.md` (integrated doctrine and methods)
3. `SKILL.md` (operational analyst execution layer)
4. `VesselFramework_Forecasting_SKILL_v1.0.md` (forecasting controls and calibration form)
5. `vesselframework_reference_v1.1_provenance_firewall.py` + `tests/` (executable reference and regression checks)

For package boundaries and canonical scope, see `CANONICAL_REFERENCE.md`.
The claim lifecycle API and its limits are documented in
[docs/claim-lifecycle.md](docs/claim-lifecycle.md).
Optional decoding, cryptography, file-inspection, and OSINT integrations are
cataloged in [docs/tool-integrations.md](docs/tool-integrations.md).

## Governing doctrine

The claim-correction case study ([docs/claim-correction-case-study.md](docs/claim-correction-case-study.md))
is a governing requirement source. Its six-step playbook has executable local
mechanisms; external integration and field validation remain separate work:

1. **Tag at intake** — every claim enters with source, tier, kind (ICD 203 report/assumption/judgment),
   uncertainty, and observation date (`vessell.provenance.intake_claim`; `vessell.validation.require_provenance_fields`).
2. **Corroborate before operationalizing** — consequential use passes through `gate_for_use` /
   `require_gate`; verification outcomes are intaked with their sightings as corroborations
   (`vessell.verify.verify_and_record`, `analyze_planted_news_and_record`, `detect_ghost_job_and_record`).
3. **Explicit waivers** — `record_waiver` (named, dated, reasoned); the remediation orchestrator's
   named approval + change ticket is the operational equivalent.
4. **Disavow by supersession, never erasure** — `disavow` keeps the original record and links the
   correction; corrections inherit kind, uncertainty, and revalidation schedule.
5. **Propagate, then verify the update landed** — `register_dependent` on every operational use;
   the managed case-study adapter writes and reads back JSON consumers before
   calling `confirm_dependent_update`. Registry acknowledgment alone does not
   verify arbitrary external systems.
6. **Re-validate on schedule** — `valid_until` + `is_stale` + `revalidate_claim`; stale corroborated
   claims fail closed for consequential use.

Step-by-step traceability lives in [docs/traceability/doctrine_code_matrix.md](docs/traceability/doctrine_code_matrix.md).

## Foundations — works this builds on

The correction playbook operationalizes three published results. Full
citations are in [docs/references.md](docs/references.md):

- **Lamport (1978)** — the happens-before relation (*a → b*): every rule of
  the playbook is a rule about causal paths — which events may follow which,
  and what must travel the path between them.
- **Castello, Redmond & Kuper (2024)** — *Inductive diagrams for causal
  reasoning* (arXiv:2307.10484): causal relationships are *witnessed by the
  paths information follows* — happens-before as paths, mechanized in Agda.
  The spine of the case study's Section 4; correction records carry
  `causal_path`, dependents register *how* a claim reached them, and a
  negative finding's search history is its witnessed path.
- **Redmond, Shen, Vazou & Kuper (2022)** — *Verified causal broadcast with
  Liquid Haskell* (arXiv:2206.14767): the machine-checked guarantee that no
  message is delivered in an order violating causality. The dependents
  registry checks analogous local ordering using `CausalOrderingError`; these
  Python checks are not that paper's machine-checked guarantee.

## Quick start

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python -m pip install -r requirements\dev.txt -r requirements\core.txt
```

Run the assurance gate:

```powershell
ruff check vessell tests
mypy vessell
pytest
```

Validate a case record:

```powershell
python -m vessell.cli example_case.json --schema case.schema.json
```

Run the Identity & Recognition Provenance Gate:

```powershell
python VesselFramework_SingleFile_EvilTwin_v0.2.py selftest
python VesselFramework_SingleFile_EvilTwin_v0.2.py recognition --subject "Alex Cvessell" --evidence example_recognition_evidence.json
```

Discover optional local analysis tools:

```sh
vessell-tools list
vessell-tools doctor
vessell-tools inspect exiftool ./artifact.bin
```

The recognition gate quarantines name-only matches, classifies recognition
stages, and counts independent provenance roots rather than search-result
quantity.

Use it as a library:

```python
from vessell import (
    EvidenceItem,
    EvidenceSet,
    ProvenanceRegistry,
    SourceStatus,
    WeightingEngine,
)

items = [
    EvidenceItem(source_id="cisa-kev", description="CISA KEV entry",
                 status=SourceStatus.SOURCE_ESTABLISHED),
    EvidenceItem(source_id="vendor-blog", description="Vendor write-up",
                 status=SourceStatus.WORKING_HYPOTHESIS),
]
registry = ProvenanceRegistry()
registry.register_many(items)

engine = WeightingEngine(registry)  # add CalibratedLlamaWeighter for live LLM scoring
weighted = engine.weight_set(EvidenceSet(registry, items))
for record in weighted.records:
    print(record.source_id, round(record.normalized_weight, 3))
```

The original flat launchers and doctrine files remain the compatibility layer for version 3.8.1. New executable functionality belongs in `vessell/`, machine-readable contracts belong in `schemas/`, and regression tests belong in `tests/`. Optional integrations are separated into `requirements/agent.txt`, `documents.txt`, and `research.txt`.

## Executable workflows and regression coverage

Five-minute tour (see `VessellFramework_Portfolio_Showcase_SKILL_v1.0.md` for the guided version):

1. `python -m pytest tests/ -q` — regression suite: provenance, validation, scanner adapters, malware triage, defense planning, remediation orchestration, agentic SOC, EvilTwin gate, Llama evidence weighting, planted-news verification, hostile-spread intel, ghost-job filtering, and the claim-correction doctrine reconciliation (`tests/test_doctrine_reconciliation.py`).
2. `python vesselframework_case_runner.py example_case.json` — structured case intake: provenance firewall, deception (maskirovka) checks, harm gate, analyst-ready report.
3. `python run_live_kev_case.py` — live CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities intake through the same pipeline.
4. `python VesselFramework_SingleFile_EvilTwin_v0.2.py selftest` — identity/recognition provenance gate.
5. `python -m pytest tests/test_weights.py tests/test_weighter.py -q` — Llama-calibrated evidence weighting with per-weight provenance.
6. `python -m pytest tests/test_verify.py -q` — planted-news corroboration checks, hostile-spread intel (burst/clone-army/laundering detection), and ghost-job filtering, each verdict shipping its audit record.

Engineering signals: typed Python, mypy + ruff gates, JSON schemas for machine-readable contracts, SHA-256 integrity manifest (`python verify_manifest.py`), CI on Python 3.13, Apache-2.0 licensed.

### Measured evaluation and remaining limits

Both case runners now share the Harm Gate assessment in `vessell/harm_gate.py`.
All seven risk/reversibility/proportionality fields must be explicit booleans
before clearance. Missing fields produce UNKNOWN exposure and review required;
invalid types fail validation. Existing partial cases intentionally require
review instead of treating omitted answers as no risk. Clearance is an intake
result, not permission to act or proof of control efficacy.

Run the reproducible external-data evaluator with an attributed CDC download
directory containing the source files and `download_manifest.json`:

```bash
python -m vessell.evaluation --data-dir /path/to/public_evaluation_data --output-dir outputs/evaluation
```

It verifies source SHA-256 values, rejects conflicting duplicate keys and malformed numeric
values, joins state ensemble incident-death forecasts to observations, and
reports exact duplicate exclusions, MAE, a prior-observation persistence comparison, 95% interval scores,
coverage, per-horizon results, and explicit exclusion counts. Paired JSON and
Markdown reports are read back and checked for exact synchronization. These
are exploratory scores of **CDC forecasts**, not proof that VessellFramework
improves forecasting. Revised archive observations do not establish the data
available at issue time. No independent external framework validation or
controlled control-efficacy study is claimed.

See [evaluation methods by framework aspect](docs/evaluation-methods.md) and
[free university/Khan Academy/YouTube method courses](docs/free-method-courses.md).

Use the [isolated replay lab](docs/replay-lab.md) to test public-data handling,
missing-intake safeguards, corrupted-source rejection and parallel consistency
without contacting real targets.

The path synchronizer verifies the post-write hash against expected content,
not merely that a hash can be read. Tests cover corrupted writes and byte-level
agreement of the packaged skill copy; this does not attest to other machines
or a private runtime that was not inspected.

## Hockey scoring-chance heat map

`vf-hockey-heatmap` projects expected goals (xG) by rink zone from public NHL
play-by-play at `api-web.nhle.com`. Install with `python -m pip install -e .`,
then run:

```sh
vf-hockey-heatmap --team STL --opponent COL --date 2026-10-03 --fetch --games 20 --observed 2026020032 --format html -o outputs/hockey/stl_col_2026-10-03.html
```

This fetches each team's last 20 completed regular-season games before the
cutoff date and adds observed maps for the supplied game ID, if available.
The example is not a claim that the game has been played or its result verified.
Only unblocked attempts are counted; shootouts and empty-net attempts are
excluded. Shot quality combines a distance-based logistic prior with zone
conversion rates; the matchup adjusts attempts by the opponent's attempts allowed.
Lineups, goalies, injuries and score effects are not modelled.

For offline use, pass play-by-play JSON files or directories instead of
`--fetch`, and a local file to `--observed`. Downloads are cached in
`--cache-dir`. Formats: HTML, terminal text, CSV and JSON. Tests use synthetic
game data only; no fabricated real-game data is included.
