# VessellFramework

VessellFramework is an auditable Python runtime and a set of doctrine and skill artifacts for evidence, provenance, case analysis, forecasting, and approved remediation control.

Author: Christopher R. Vessell

Current package state: v3.8.1 rough working candidate prepared for graduate-level review and feedback.

For the complete skill, agent, executable-code, scanner, and authorized remediation map, start with [VesselFramework_Agent.md](VesselFramework_Agent.md). Historical artifacts retain their original `VesselFramework` names; the active Python namespace is `vessell`.

## Reviewer quick orientation

If you are reviewing this as an academic rough-working submission, read in this order:

1. `PROFESSOR_README.md` (purpose, contribution, current limits, and requested feedback)
2. `VesselFramework_MetaMatrix_Framework_v3.8_v3.9_Combined.md` (integrated doctrine and methods)
3. `SKILL.md` (operational analyst execution layer)
4. `VesselFramework_Forecasting_SKILL_v1.0.md` (forecasting controls and calibration form)
5. `vessell/provenance_firewall.py` + `tests/` (executable reference and regression checks; `vesselframework_reference_v1.1_provenance_firewall.py` remains as the documented entry point)

For package boundaries and canonical scope, see `CANONICAL_REFERENCE.md`.

## Governing doctrine

The claim-correction case study ([docs/claim-correction-case-study.md](docs/claim-correction-case-study.md))
is the governing spec for this codebase. Its six-step playbook is implemented head-to-toe:

1. **Tag at intake** — every claim enters with source, tier, kind (ICD 203 report/assumption/judgment),
   uncertainty, and observation date (`vessell.provenance.intake_claim`; `vessell.validation.require_provenance_fields`).
2. **Corroborate before operationalizing** — consequential use passes through `gate_for_use` /
   `require_gate`; verification outcomes are intaked with their sightings as corroborations
   (`vessell.verify.verify_and_record`, `analyze_planted_news_and_record`, `detect_ghost_job_and_record`).
3. **Explicit waivers** — `record_waiver` (named, dated, reasoned); the remediation orchestrator's
   named approval + change ticket is the operational equivalent.
4. **Disavow by supersession, never erasure** — `disavow` keeps the original record and links the
   correction; corrections inherit kind, uncertainty, and revalidation schedule.
5. **Propagate, then verify the update landed** — `register_dependent` on every operational use;
   `confirm_dependent_update` / `pending_corrections` close the loop.
6. **Re-validate on schedule** — `valid_until` + `is_stale` + `revalidate_claim`; stale corroborated
   claims fail closed for consequential use.

Step-by-step traceability lives in [docs/traceability/doctrine_code_matrix.md](docs/traceability/doctrine_code_matrix.md).

## Search Gate

[Search Gate doctrine](VesselFramework_Search_Gate_SKILL_v0.1.md) is NEW /
PROSPECTIVE / NOT VALIDATED and subordinate to Evidence Assurance and the Harm
Gate. It requires scoped search and opened primary confirmation before claims;
summaries remain hypotheses, inaccessible content stays unverified, and unknown
or incompatible licences block imports. Agents follow
[`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](.github/copilot-instructions.md).

The deterministic offline checker evaluates supplied records, not source truth:

```sh
vf-search-gate check-license CC-BY-4.0 --json
vf-search-gate check-import code GPL-2.0+ Apache-2.0 --json
vf-search-gate evaluate code/safety-check /tmp/search-records.json --json
```

`evaluate` accepts a JSON array for one exact claim, following
`vessell/schemas/search.record.schema.json`. Each record requires `query`, `tool`,
`scope`, `result_count`, `limit_hit`, `primary_source_opened`, `status` and
`what_was_not_checked`; add `primary_source` for clearance and `corrected_name`
when needed. Evidence statuses are `WORKING HYPOTHESIS`, `SOURCE-ESTABLISHED` and
`UNVERIFIED`. Exit codes: 0 cleared, 1 not cleared, 2 invalid input.
Licence classification alone does not authorize an import: first open the
applicable primary licence, check compatibility, preserve attribution and record
any owner-approved relicensing decision. Include SEARCH RECORDs for external
facts/imports in PR descriptions. No third-party material is imported by this gate.

## Foundations — works this builds on

The correction playbook operationalizes three published results. Full
citations are in [docs/references.md](docs/references.md):

- **Lamport (1978)** — the happens-before relation (*a → b*): every rule of
  the playbook is a rule about causal paths — which events may follow which,
  and what must travel the path between them.
- **Castello, Redmond & Kuper (2024)** — *Inductive diagrams for causal
  reasoning* (arXiv:2307.10484): causal relationships are *witnessed by the
  paths information follows* — happens-before as paths, mechanized in Agda.
  The spine of the case study's Section 4; correction records carry
  `causal_path`, dependents register *how* a claim reached them, and a
  negative finding's search history is its witnessed path.
- **Redmond, Shen, Vazou & Kuper (2022)** — *Verified causal broadcast with
  Liquid Haskell* (arXiv:2206.14767): the machine-checked guarantee that no
  message is delivered in an order violating causality. The dependents
  registry is that guarantee in miniature — `CausalOrderingError` instead of
  silent out-of-order completion.

## Quick start

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python -m pip install -r requirements\dev.txt -r requirements\core.txt
```

Run the assurance gate:

```powershell
ruff check .
mypy
python verify_manifest.py
pytest
```

CI runs the same four gates on every push and pull request. `mypy` is strict and
covers both the `vessell` package and the root-level runner scripts.

Validate a case record:

```powershell
python -m vessell.cli example_case.json --schema case.schema.json
```

Run the Identity & Recognition Provenance Gate:

```powershell
python VesselFramework_SingleFile_EvilTwin_v0.2.py selftest
python VesselFramework_SingleFile_EvilTwin_v0.2.py recognition --subject "Alex Cvessell" --evidence example_recognition_evidence.json
```

The recognition gate quarantines name-only matches, classifies recognition
stages, and counts independent provenance roots rather than search-result
quantity.

Render the verification heat map (claim x source matrix) for a batch of
claim checks — terminal, standalone HTML, CSV, or raw JSON:

```powershell
python -m vessell.heatmap example_event_checks.json                      # colour terminal grid
python -m vessell.heatmap example_event_checks.json --format html -o outputs/heatmaps/event.html
python -m vessell.heatmap example_event_checks.json --format csv
```

(Installed entry point: `vf-heatmap`.) Each row is a claim run through
`verify_claim` (verdict + independence-discounted score); each cell is the
source's tier weight — blue affirms, red denies, grey is silent — on the
colour-blind-safe ColorBrewer `RdBu` diverging scale. Repeat sightings from
one source (e.g. at 10' and 41' of a live event) are merged into one cell
listing every event clock. In code: `vessell.report.event_matrix(checks)`
builds the grid and `vessell.heatmap.render_html / render_text / render_csv`
render it.

### Attack-surface scanner heat map

`vf-attack-surface` turns the output of open-source scanners into an
asset × exposure heat map (worst risk per cell on a 0–10 ColorBrewer
`YlOrRd` scale; CISA KEV hits are outlined). VesselFramework does not bundle
the scanners. You run them yourself, **only against assets you are
authorized to test**, and point the CLI at their exported reports:

| Tool | Export flag | What it adds to the map | Project / license |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Nmap](https://nmap.org) | `-sV --script vulners -oX nmap.xml` | open services (remote-admin, database, file-share, web, mail) + CVEs | Nmap Public Source License |
| [Nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei) | `-jsonl -o nuclei.jsonl` | known vulns, misconfigurations, exposed panels/secrets | MIT |
| [naabu](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu) | `-json -o naabu.jsonl` | open ports | MIT |
| [httpx](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx) | `-json -o httpx.jsonl` | live web endpoints + tech | MIT |
| [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) | `--format json -o trivy.json` | vulnerable dependencies, misconfigs, leaked secrets | Apache-2.0 |
| [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) | `-o json > grype.json` | vulnerable dependencies | Apache-2.0 |
| [OSV-Scanner](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner) | `--format json > osv.json` | vulnerable dependencies | Apache-2.0 |

```powershell
vf-attack-surface tests/fixtures/attack_surface/nmap.xml tests/fixtures/attack_surface/nuclei.jsonl `
  tests/fixtures/attack_surface/trivy.json --inventory tests/fixtures/attack_surface/inventory.json `
  --kev tests/fixtures/attack_surface/kev.json --format html -o outputs/attack_surface/surface.html
```

- The format is detected automatically (`--input-format` overrides it).
- `--kev FILE` or `--fetch-kev` raises any CVE in the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog to 10.0.
- `--inventory` maps hostnames and IPs onto asset IDs (via optional `hostnames` / `addresses` lists). It flags network hosts nobody has inventoried as `shadow-asset`.
- `--scan-local trivy|osv-scanner PATH` runs a locally installed code scanner.
- In the remediation control room (`vf-remediator`), `GET /attack-surface` renders the same heat map from the reports in `ATTACK_SURFACE_DIR`.

### Hockey scoring-chance heat map

`vf-hockey-heatmap` projects expected goals (xG) by rink zone for one NHL team against an opponent. It works from public play-by-play data from `api-web.nhle.com`, the feed behind NHL.com Gamecenter.

```powershell
# Pull each team's last 20 completed regular-season games, then project STL @ COL on 2026-10-03
vf-hockey-heatmap --team STL --opponent COL --date 2026-10-03 --fetch --games 20 `
  --observed 2026020032 --format html -o outputs/hockey/stl_col_2026-10-03.html
```

How the projection is built:
- **Shots counted:** unblocked attempts only (goals, shots on goal and missed shots). Blocked shots, shootouts and empty-net attempts are excluded. Coordinates are normalised so every attempt attacks the same net.
- **Shot quality:** a distance-based logistic xG prior with empirical-Bayes conversion rates per zone.
- **Matchup:** each team's attempts per game are adjusted by the opponent's attempts allowed per game (log5).
- **Observed overlay:** `--observed` adds the actual shot map for a game already played.
- **Cutoff:** `--date` restricts the sample to games played before that date.
- **Offline use:** play-by-play JSON files or directories can be passed instead of `--fetch`. Downloads are cached in `--cache-dir`.
- **Limits:** this is a statistical projection from historical shot locations. Lineups, goaltenders, injuries and score effects are not modelled.

Use it as a library:

```python
from vessell import (
    EvidenceItem,
    EvidenceSet,
    ProvenanceRegistry,
    SourceStatus,
    WeightingEngine,
)

items = [
    EvidenceItem(source_id="cisa-kev", description="CISA KEV entry",
                 status=SourceStatus.SOURCE_ESTABLISHED),
    EvidenceItem(source_id="vendor-blog", description="Vendor write-up",
                 status=SourceStatus.WORKING_HYPOTHESIS),
]
registry = ProvenanceRegistry()
registry.register_many(items)

engine = WeightingEngine(registry)  # add CalibratedLlamaWeighter for live LLM scoring
weighted = engine.weight_set(EvidenceSet(registry, items))
for record in weighted.records:
    print(record.source_id, round(record.normalized_weight, 3))
```

The original flat launchers and doctrine files remain the compatibility layer for version 3.8.1. New executable functionality belongs in `vessell/`, machine-readable contracts belong in `vessell/schemas/` (shipped in the wheel), and regression tests belong in `tests/`. Optional integrations are separated into `requirements/agent.txt`, `documents.txt`, and `research.txt`.

## What this demonstrates

Five-minute tour (see `VessellFramework_Portfolio_Showcase_SKILL_v1.0.md` for the guided version):

1. `python -m pytest tests/ -q` — 264-test regression suite: provenance, validation, scanner adapters, malware triage, defense planning, remediation orchestration, agentic SOC, EvilTwin gate, Llama evidence weighting, planted-news verification, root-script input validation, hostile-spread intel, ghost-job filtering, verification and attack-surface heat maps, and the claim-correction doctrine reconciliation (`tests/test_doctrine_reconciliation.py`).
2. `python vesselframework_case_runner.py example_case.json` — structured case intake: provenance firewall, deception (maskirovka) checks, harm gate, analyst-ready report.
3. `python run_live_kev_case.py` — live CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities intake through the same pipeline.
4. `python VesselFramework_SingleFile_EvilTwin_v0.2.py selftest` — identity/recognition provenance gate.
5. `python -m pytest tests/test_weights.py tests/test_weighter.py -q` — Llama-calibrated evidence weighting with per-weight provenance.
6. `python -m pytest tests/test_verify.py -q` — planted-news corroboration checks, hostile-spread intel (burst/clone-army/laundering detection), and ghost-job filtering, each verdict shipping its audit record.

Engineering signals: typed Python, mypy + ruff gates, JSON schemas for machine-readable contracts, SHA-256 integrity manifest (`python verify_manifest.py`), CI on Python 3.13, Apache-2.0 licensed.
