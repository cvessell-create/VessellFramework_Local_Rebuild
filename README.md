VessellFramework is an auditable Python runtime and a set of doctrine and skill artifacts for evidence, provenance, case analysis, forecasting, and approved remediation control.

Author: Christopher R. Vessell

Current package state: v3.8.1 rough working candidate prepared for graduate-level review and feedback.

For the complete skill, agent, executable-code, scanner, and authorized remediation map, start with [VesselFramework_Agent.md](VesselFramework_Agent.md). Historical artifacts retain their original `VesselFramework` names; the active Python namespace is `vessell`.

## Reviewer quick orientation

If you are reviewing this as an academic rough-working submission, read in this order:

1. `PROFESSOR_README.md` (purpose, contribution, current limits, and requested feedback)
2. `VesselFramework_MetaMatrix_Framework_v3.8_v3.9_Combined.md` (integrated doctrine and methods)
3. `SKILL.md` (operational analyst execution layer)
4. `VesselFramework_Forecasting_SKILL_v1.0.md` (forecasting controls and calibration form)
5. `vesselframework_reference_v1.1_provenance_firewall.py` + `tests/` (executable reference and regression checks)

For package boundaries and canonical scope, see `CANONICAL_REFERENCE.md`.

## Governing doctrine

The claim-correction case study ([docs/claim-correction-case-study.md](docs/claim-correction-case-study.md))
is the governing spec for this codebase. Its six-step playbook is implemented head-to-toe:

1. **Tag at intake** — every claim enters with source, tier, kind (ICD 203 report/assumption/judgment),
   uncertainty, and observation date (`vessell.provenance.intake_claim`; `vessell.validation.require_provenance_fields`).
2. **Corroborate before operationalizing** — consequential use passes through `gate_for_use` /
   `require_gate`; verification outcomes are intaked with their sightings as corroborations
   (`vessell.verify.verify_and_record`, `analyze_planted_news_and_record`, `detect_ghost_job_and_record`).
3. **Explicit waivers** — `record_waiver` (named, dated, reasoned); the remediation orchestrator's
   named approval + change ticket is the operational equivalent.
4. **Disavow by supersession, never erasure** — `disavow` keeps the original record and links the
   correction; corrections inherit kind, uncertainty, and revalidation schedule.
5. **Propagate, then verify the update landed** — `register_dependent` on every operational use;
   `confirm_dependent_update` / `pending_corrections` close the loop.
6. **Re-validate on schedule** — `valid_until` + `is_stale` + `revalidate_claim`; stale corroborated
   claims fail closed for consequential use.

Step-by-step traceability lives in [docs/traceability/doctrine_code_matrix.md](docs/traceability/doctrine_code_matrix.md).

## Foundations — works this builds on

The correction playbook operationalizes three published results. Full
citations are in [docs/references.md](docs/references.md):

- **Lamport (1978)** — the happens-before relation (*a → b*): every rule of
  the playbook is a rule about causal paths — which events may follow which,
  and what must travel the path between them.
- **Castello, Redmond & Kuper (2024)** — *Inductive diagrams for causal
  reasoning* (arXiv:2307.10484): causal relationships are *witnessed by the
  paths information follows* — happens-before as paths, mechanized in Agda.
  The spine of the case study's Section 4; correction records carry
  `causal_path`, dependents register *how* a claim reached them, and a
  negative finding's search history is its witnessed path.
- **Redmond, Shen, Vazou & Kuper (2022)** — *Verified causal broadcast with
  Liquid Haskell* (arXiv:2206.14767): the machine-checked guarantee that no
  message is delivered in an order violating causality. The dependents
  registry is that guarantee in miniature — `CausalOrderingError` instead of
  silent out-of-order completion.

## Quick start

### Run the Claim Verifier web app

The fastest way to see the framework working — no install step, just Python 3.12+:

```powershell
python -m vessell.app
```

This starts the Claim Verifier at http://127.0.0.1:8765/ and opens your browser.
It is the real `vessell/verify.py` doctrine behind a web UI, not a mock:

- **Verify a claim** — enter a claim plus its source sightings; get the
  tier-weighted, independence-discounted verdict (VERIFIED → CONTRADICTED)
  with the full audit trail.
- **Planted-news spread** — hunt synchronized bursts, text-clone armies,
  single-origin laundering, and orphaned circulation
  (AUTHENTIC → LIKELY_PLANTED).
- **Ghost-job filter** — paste job-posting sightings; get the ghost verdict
  with its signal details.

Each tab ships a one-click worked example (Wauna earthquake, bridge-closure
scare, Uline ghost pattern). The same engine is also a JSON API
(`POST /api/verify`, `/api/planted-news`, `/api/ghost-job`) — see
`vessell/app/server.py` for the contract.

### Developer setup

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python -m pip install -r requirements\dev.txt -r requirements\core.txt
```

Run the assurance gate:

```powershell
ruff check vessell tests
mypy vessell
pytest
```

Validate a case record:

```powershell
python -m vessell.cli example_case.json --schema case.schema.json
```

Run the Identity & Recognition Provenance Gate:

```powershell
python VesselFramework_SingleFile_EvilTwin_v0.2.py selftest
python VesselFramework_SingleFile_EvilTwin_v0.2.py recognition --subject "Alex Cvessell" --evidence example_recognition_evidence.json
```

The recognition gate quarantines name-only matches, classifies recognition
stages, and counts independent provenance roots rather than search-result
quantity.

Use it as a library:

```python
from vessell import (
    EvidenceItem,
    EvidenceSet,
    ProvenanceRegistry,
    SourceStatus,
    WeightingEngine,
)

items = [
    EvidenceItem(source_id="cisa-kev", description="CISA KEV entry",
                 status=SourceStatus.SOURCE_ESTABLISHED),
    EvidenceItem(source_id="vendor-blog", description="Vendor write-up",
                 status=SourceStatus.WORKING_HYPOTHESIS),
]
registry = ProvenanceRegistry()
registry.register_many(items)

engine = WeightingEngine(registry)  # add CalibratedLlamaWeighter for live LLM scoring
weighted = engine.weight_set(EvidenceSet(registry, items))
for record in weighted.records:
    print(record.source_id, round(record.normalized_weight, 3))
```

The original flat launchers and doctrine files remain the compatibility layer for version 3.8.1. New executable functionality belongs in `vessell/`, machine-readable contracts belong in `schemas/`, and regression tests belong in `tests/`. Optional integrations are separated into `requirements/agent.txt`, `documents.txt`, and `research.txt`.

## What this demonstrates

Five-minute tour (see `VessellFramework_Portfolio_Showcase_SKILL_v1.0.md` for the guided version):

1. `python -m vessell.app` — the working Claim Verifier web app: verify claims, analyze hostile spread, and filter ghost jobs through the real doctrine, in your browser.
2. `python -m pytest tests/ -q` — 206-test regression suite: provenance, validation, scanner adapters, malware triage, defense planning, remediation orchestration, agentic SOC, EvilTwin gate, Llama evidence weighting, planted-news verification, hostile-spread intel, ghost-job filtering, the claim-correction doctrine reconciliation (`tests/test_doctrine_reconciliation.py`), live-event verification (`tests/test_live_event_verification.py`), cross-domain maskirovka convergence benchmarks (`tests/conformance/test_maskirovka_convergence.py`), and end-to-end output snapshots (`tests/conformance/test_output_snapshot.py`).
2. `python vesselframework_case_runner.py example_case.json` — structured case intake: provenance firewall, deception (maskirovka) checks, harm gate, analyst-ready report.
3. `python run_live_kev_case.py` — live CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities intake through the same pipeline.
4. `python VesselFramework_SingleFile_EvilTwin_v0.2.py selftest` — identity/recognition provenance gate.
5. `python -m pytest tests/test_weights.py tests/test_weighter.py -q` — Llama-calibrated evidence weighting with per-weight provenance.
6. `python -m pytest tests/test_verify.py -q` — planted-news corroboration checks, hostile-spread intel (burst/clone-army/laundering detection), and ghost-job filtering, each verdict shipping its audit record.
